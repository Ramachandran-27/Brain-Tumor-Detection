# Brain Tumor Detection with Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation
 # Overview:
 
A CNN-based model that classifies Brain MRI images into tumor types like Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary. It also uses transfer learning for faster convergence and higher accuracy.

 # Features:
 
• Classifies Brain MRI images into Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary tumor types

• Utilizes transfer learning with pre-trained models such as ResNet-50, MobileNet, and VGG-16

• Applies data augmentation techniques like random rotation,flipping,zooming,scaling,contrast and cropping to increase robustness of the model and reduce overfitting

• Compares performance of custom CNN with transfer learning architectures

 # Results:
• Achieved up to 91% validation accuracy

• Reduced training time and improved performance using transfer learning

# Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
